Keras IMDB Dataset Info:

Keras provides access to the IMDB dataset built-in.

The keras.datasets.imdb.load_data() allows you to load the dataset in a format that is ready for use in neural network and deep learning models.

The words have been replaced by integers that indicate the absolute popularity of the word in the dataset. The sentences in each review are therefore comprised of a sequence of integers.

Calling imdb.load_data() the first time will download the IMDB dataset to your computer and store it in your home directory under ~/.keras/datasets/imdb.pkl as a 32 megabyte file.

Usefully, the imdb.load_data() provides additional arguments including the number of top words to load (where words with a lower integer are marked as zero in the returned data), the number of top words to skip (to avoid the “the”‘s) and the maximum length of reviews to support.
